\\NOTE: remove this before parsing or use(build time)
This shows an example of a config file that provides the details needed for the database connection
as well as the engine to be used. This is needed at build time(See CMakeLists.txt file) so it is best
u have a database ready by then. To change the engine or database name, u have to rebuild the library again.
Bummer...will be resolved tho.

This does not support databases over networks yet.
